/**
 * FlexConversion CSS Overrides
 *
 * This file contains custom styles to override FlexConversion's
 * default rental calendar and pricing UI to match the Berlin Minimal
 * design direction.
 *
 * FlexConversion injects its own JS/CSS on PDP pages.
 * These overrides ensure visual consistency with the brand.
 *
 * Target: HURR-style horizontal duration cards, branded calendar.
 *
 * NOTE: Populate these overrides once FlexConversion is installed
 * and its CSS class names are inspected.
